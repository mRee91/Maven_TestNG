1.
@BeforeClass-->execute just once before the class starts to execute
@Afterclass--> execute just once after the whole class has executed

2. Data Provider
if we have a diverse data set then we can use data provider to feed the test data to our test case

@dataProvider(naem="crdentials")
we declare the data in a form of ZDarray

if i want to use data provider in a tet case
@Test (dataProvider='credentials')
public void login(String a, string b, String c){}

in order to use to use data from 2D array i must give in the parameters .
the parameters are going to be equal to the number of columns , will the follow a sequence.
How many times the function @Test is going to execute ???? --> euqal to the number of rows we have in our Data provider

---------------------------Listeners------------------
why do we need listeners?
because we have no way of performing an action if our test case pass,fails,ignores e,t,c

How do we use listeners?
1.Create a class that implements ITestListener
@Override the functions available to us in ITestListener

ontestSucces()
OnTestFailure()

2.Link it to the class/package through the xml file.

<Suite>
    <lsiteneres>
        <listenrs name="what ever class you hvae implmented ur listenrs in"/>
    <listeneres>
    <test>
    </test>
</suite>
